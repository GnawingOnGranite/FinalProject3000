Credit Card Fraud Detection – Project Proposal

1. Problem Definition
Credit card fraud is a widespread and costly issue for both consumers and financial institutions. Fraud leads to billions of dollars in annual losses and forces customers to endure the inconvenient process of disputing unauthorized charges, cancelling cards, and waiting for replacements.
Due to the massive volume of transactions that occur every second, it is impossible for banks to manually verify every payment. Fraudulent patterns are often subtle, dynamic, and intentionally deceptive—making traditional rule-based systems insufficient.
Machine learning enables the automated detection of suspicious behavioral patterns by learning from historical transaction data. Because ML models can adapt to new trends and anomalies, they offer a scalable and robust solution for fraud detection.

2. Project Objective
Develop a machine learning system that evaluates each new credit card transaction by comparing it to the cardholder’s historical behavior. The model will output a probability that the transaction is fraudulent.
Primary Goal
Minimize false negatives
 Prevent customers from losing money by correctly identifying fraudulent transactions wherever possible.


Secondary Goal
Minimize false positives
 Avoid unnecessary declines of legitimate purchases and reduce customer inconvenience.



3. Data & System Context
Banks have access to historical transaction patterns for each customer, including:
Time of day transactions typically occur

Purchase amounts


Merchant types and categories


Geographic locations


Frequency and patterns of spending


This behavioral history allows the model to assess how “unusual” a new transaction is relative to past activity.

4. Proposed Methods
This section outlines how the project will be executed from preprocessing through model evaluation.
4.1 Data Preprocessing
Display descriptive statistics and check for missing values


Handle missing data via imputation or removal


One-hot encode categorical features (e.g., merchant type, location)


Z-normalize continuous variables (e.g., purchase amount, time-of-day encoding)


4.2 Model Training
Train and compare multiple supervised learning models:
Logistic Regression


Baseline linear classifier


Interpretable and efficient


k-Nearest Neighbors (k = 3)


Non-parametric, similarity-based classifier


Useful for detecting unusual transactions resembling no known patterns


Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)


Captures nonlinear relationships


Often effective with high-dimensional data


(Optional) Additional Models for Exploration


Random Forest


Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)


Neural networks (if dataset size warrants)


4.3 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate each model using:
Confusion Matrix


Precision


Recall (critical for minimizing false negatives)


F1-Score


Accuracy


ROC Curve


Area Under the Curve (AUC)


4.4 Model Selection
Select the best model based on the above metrics, prioritizing recall and AUC while balancing precision to avoid excessive false positives.
4.5 Deployment Plan
Package the chosen model


Integrate it into a simulated fraud-scoring pipeline


Test on a separate validation dataset


Report performance and recommendations for real-world deployment



5. Project Workflow Summary
Data exploration and cleaning


Feature engineering (one-hot encoding, normalization)


Model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, optional models)


Model evaluation using multiple metrics


ROC/AUC comparison
